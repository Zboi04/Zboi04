- 👋 Hi, I’m Zack!
- 👀 I’m interested in decentralized technology, space, history, and a plethora of other things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Jira and Jenkins to fine-tune my DevOps skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing Web3 projects, specifically ones built on the Koii Network and the Filecoin Virtual Machine, but I'm keen helping many more!
